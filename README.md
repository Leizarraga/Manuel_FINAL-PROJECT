# Manuel_FINAL-PROJECT
This code performs a number of spelling changes in a given order. It has been conceived to update the spelling of Old Souletin texts (Eastern Basque) into present-day standard Basque spelling. 

I have used a function for case sensitive replacement, and a series of replacements by means of REGEX. Additionally, the project includes a function to count the changes operated by each rule. 

The resulting text would need of revision by a philologist, because variation in spelling includes exceptions to the rules. Nevertheless, I think that this code is very helpful to automatize the task of modernizing spelling of Souletin Basque. 

As a final remark, this conversor of spelling is far from being "universal" for Old Basque texts (even for those written in the Souletin dialect), since variation in spelling is important. However, the main guidelines of this code are supposed to work in most of the cases. Of course, it is always possible to adapt this code by introducing new rules or changing existent ones.
